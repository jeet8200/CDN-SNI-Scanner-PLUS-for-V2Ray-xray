## Examples

**Scan a single domain:**
```text
> python cdn_scanner_plus.py
> Select option 1
> Enter domain: example.com
```

**Batch scan from file:**
- Put domains in `domains.txt` (one per line)
- Choose option 3 in the menu

**Test random Cloudflare IPs:**
```text
> Select option 2
> Choose Cloudflare
> Enter number of IPs: 100
> Enter SNI: example.com
```

---

## Configuration

- Edit `config.ini` to change DNS servers, rate limits, or add custom CDN IP ranges.

---

## Output

- Results saved in `results/valid_pairs.json` (JSON) and `results/valid_pairs.txt` (TXT)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **"Python not found"**: Make sure Python is in your PATH or use `python3`
- **SSL errors**: Normal — tool ignores SSL verification
- **Slow scans**: Lower `rate_limit_delay` in `config.ini`
